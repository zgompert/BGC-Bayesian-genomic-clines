# BGC-Bayesian-genomic-clines
Collection of code for Bayesian genomic cline analyses

I am in the process of migrating code for `bgc` to `GitHub`. I am also developing new versions of `bgc`.

See the [manual](bgc_manual.pdf) for compilation instructions for the standard, stable version of the code (version 1.03). The version of the software documented in the manual corresponds to the files with `v1.03` in their names. Files without this designation correspond with a version of the software used for our recent analysis of structural variants in *Lycaeides* ([Zhang et al. 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.14.476419v1)). These can be used by others, but I suggest writing me for usage details as the new models are not yet documented in the manual. Additional new, stable versions of `bgc` are under development (relase planned in May/June 2023). Please check back for updates soon.
