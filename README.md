# BGC-Bayesian-genomic-clines
Collection of code for Bayesian genomic cline analyses

I am currently developing new versions of `bgc`.

See the [manual](bgc_manual.pdf) for compilation instructions for the standard, stable version of the code (version 1.03, also available from my [website](https://sites.google.com/site/bgcsoftware/)). Files with `v1.06` correspond with a version of the software used for our recent analysis of structural variants in *Lycaeides*. These can be used by others, but I suggest writing me for usage details as the new models are not yet documented in the manual. Additional new, stable versions of `bgc` are under development. Please check back for updates soon.
